          <h1>Ford Mustang</h1>
          <p>
            The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by
            Ford. In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently
            the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its sixth
            generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The
            namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was
            developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles
            derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by "long
            hood, short deck" proportions. Originally predicted to sell 100,000
            vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle
            launch since the 1927 Model A. Introduced on April 17, 1964, over
            400,000 units in its first year; the one-millionth Mustang was sold
            within two years of its launch. In August 2018, Ford produced the
            10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle
            was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine.

          <h1>Audi R8</h1>
          <p>
            The Audi R8 is a mid-engine, 2-seater sports car, which uses Audi's
            trademark quattro permanent all-wheel drive system. It was
            introduced by the German car manufacturer Audi AG in 2006. The car
            is exclusively designed, developed, and manufactured by Audi AG's
            private subsidiary company manufacturing high performance automotive
            parts, Audi Sport GmbH , and is based on the Lamborghini Gallardo
            and presently the Huracán platform. The fundamental construction of
            the R8 is based on the Audi Space Frame, and uses an aluminium
            monocoque which is built using space frame principles. The car is
            built by Audi Sport GmbH in a newly renovated factory at Audi's
            'aluminium site' at Neckarsulm in Germany. It is also the first
            production car with full-LED headlamps.

          <h1>Mercedes-Benz G-Class</h1>
          <p>
            The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, sometimes called G-Wagon (short for
            Geländewagen, "terrain vehicle"), is a four-wheel drive automobile
            manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Austria
            and sold by Mercedes-Benz. Originally developed as a military
            off-roader, later more luxurious models were added to the line. In
            certain markets, it has been sold under the Puch name as Puch G. The
            G-Wagon is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame
            construction. It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the
            few vehicles to have such a feature. Despite the introduction of an
            intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in
            2006, the G-Class is still in production and is one of the
            longest-produced vehicles in Daimler's history, with a span of 42
            years. Only the Unimog surpasses it. Puch G The success and
            longevity of the G-Class has reached another milestone: the
            400,000th unit was built on 4 December 2020. The 300,000th unit was
            built in July 2017.
